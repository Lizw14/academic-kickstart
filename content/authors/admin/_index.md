I am a 5th-year PhD student at Johns Hopkins University, supervised by [Prof. Alan Yuille](https://cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) and [Prof. Benjamin Van Durme](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~vandurme/index.html). I am a member of [CCVL lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/team/). Before this, I received my B.E. degree at Tsinghua Univeristy in 2018. I have also spent wonderful times at Facebook, Adobe and Sensetime.

My research interest focuses on **computer vision and natural language processing**. My works relates to both large-scale pretraining and compositional models. I am also interested in model diagnosis including robustness, generaliation, compositionality, etc. I believe that the joint learning of vision and language offers mutual benefits!

I am <span style="color:red"> **on the job market** </span> for research positions in 2023, including full-time/internship positions in industry and post-docs positions. Don't hesitate to reach out to me (at zli110 at jhu dot edu) if there is a potential fit:)

In part time, I am a big fan of outdoor sports including rock climbing (recovering from a finger injury üò≠), snowboarding, skiing, hiking, mountaineering, etc. Recently I also spent time in learning piano.
